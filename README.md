# Obstacle-Detecting-Car
A simple car with a SONAR sensor integrated to it in order to detect obstacles and stop when too close.

This is the code and semantics to an Arduino UNO project that focuses on automating a vehiche until an obstacle is detected infront of it

USED:
1) SONAR Sensor HC-SR04
2) Motor Driver L298N
3) Servo Motor SG90
4) Microcontroller Arduino Uno R3 SMD
5) Arduino Sensor Shield V5
6) DC Gear Motor 6V
7) 2 Wheel robot chasis with caster
